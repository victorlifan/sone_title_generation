    "1. ***Extractive Summary:*** the network calculates the most important sentences from the text and gets them together to provide the most meaningful information from the text.\n",
    "2. ***Abstractive Summary***: The network creates new sentences to encapsulate maximum gist of the text and generates that as output. The sentences in the summary may or may not be contained in the text. \n",

    "    - ***T5*** in many ways is one of its kind transformers architecture that not only gives state of the art results in many NLP tasks, but also has a very radical approach to NLP tasks.\n",
    "    - **Text-2-Text** - According to the graphic taken from the T5 paper. All NLP tasks are converted to a **text-to-text** problem. Tasks such as translation, classification, summarization and question answering, all of them are treated as a text-to-text conversion problem, rather than seen as separate unique problem statements.\n",
    "    - **Unified approach for NLP Deep Learning** - Since the task is reflected purely in the text input and output, you can use the same model, objective, training procedure, and decoding process to ANY task. Above framework can be used for any task - show Q&A, summarization, etc. \n",

It is designed to seamlessly integrate with all the Machine Learning and Deep Learning Frameworks. Each script can be organized into *Project* and each execution of the script will be registered as a *run* in the respective project.\n",
